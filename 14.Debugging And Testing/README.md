# Debugging And Testing

>This folder has examples of how you can easily debug your code by setting stop points. Each file has a Vidoe that I would recommend seeing before 
>you look at the code. Pls, note that few programs will not run and it is that way to demonstrate debugging and not by mistake. 
>All of the examples here are shows and run on "IntelliJ IDEA" most of the functions of debugging will be the same for other platforms also, but they may vary.

#### [1. Introduction](1.Introduction/src)

Here you can see an example of basic debugging. Pls, see the video to understand what is to be done.

#### [2. Watches Field Watch Points](2.Watches-Field-Watch-Points/src)

Watchers and watchpoints are very helpful when we are having problems with a certain variable not having the proper value and want to follow it.

#### [3. Advance Debugging Step Into](3.Advance-Debugging-Step-Into/src)

Using the Step Into feature we can follow the code as it goes through various function calls in different libraries.
