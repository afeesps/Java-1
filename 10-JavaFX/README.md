# JavaFX

>>Examples for all JavaFX components. Almost everything you will need to build a GUI is here for your reference. 

---

#### Note

- Allot of the files have commented out code, this is because I could not implement different projects for all views and components of JavaFX.
They are all working, pls un-comment this and comment the current parts and run the program to view. 
- If the code is not working, pls confirm that you have the JavaFX libraries in your IDE. If not then pls import them to the project, or add them to the IDE.

### [10 Todo List](10-To-Do-List/src/javafx/toDoList)

![GIF](10-To-Do-List/media/10.gif)

This is an application that will track a list of things to do. We can add new items. There are 2 controllers and 2 .fxml files these are for the main window and the dialogue box to add new items. The data is stored in a text file. Currently, the data is being updated every time through code when it is changed. In the next part, you can see the data and view have been bound, i.e. the view will automatically update when data is added or deleted. This is a faster and better method to update the view.
