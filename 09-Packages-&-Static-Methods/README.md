>>Implementation of Packages and Static Methods

---

This is a single project and shows the implementation of static methods and the use of different packages from external java programs. 
The 'Packages-Example-Main' file has the main method which calls sum and factors methods from the 'PackagesExampleMethords'. In the main class, we can see an example of how packages are used.
To understand how static methods are used pls refer to the second file.
