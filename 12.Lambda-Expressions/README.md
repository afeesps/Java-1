# Lambda Expressions

>>A Lambda Expression is a small block of code like a method. It is shorter and can return a code. 
>>Lambda expressions are very useful to replace anonymous methods or normal methods.

#### [1. Introduction](1.Introduction/src)

Basic syntax and use of lambda expressions. You can see normal ways to run a block of code and then how we can implement the same through lambda expressions. 
Here I have used Lambda expressions in Runnable Threads also.

#### [2. Button JavaFx - Lambda Expressions](2.Button-Fx-Lambda-Expressions/src/sample)

Java Fx is the most common use of Lambda expressions. 
Here you can see a small example of Lambda expressions being used in JavaFX, in which we call a method that uses it when a button is pressed.

#### [3. Interface Returning Value](3.Interface-Returning-Value/src)

When an expression is just one like we don't need to explicitly return a value, but when we write expressions that are bigger than that we have to return the value manually.
Here you can see examples of a multi-line expression using an anonymous class and a Lambda expression. You can also see the use of a non-Static class 'AnotherClass'.

#### [4. Eployees Predicate](4.Employees-Predicate/src)

Predicates and Suppliers and Consumers and a lot more can be seen in this file. You can see examples of functions, Channing functions, BIFunction, Unary Operator, 
supplier, consumer, and Predicates. 

---

#### [5. Streams](5.Streams/src)

here we can see an example of using streams, we use this in one example to sort an array. You can also see examples of, ````.collect, .sorted, .forEach, .filter````.

---

#### [6. Flat Map & More](6.Flat-Map-&-More/src)

We can see examples of ````.flatMap```` here, we use this for basic operations.

---

#### [7. Final Compilation](7.Final-Compilation/src)

This is a program that is using all the concepts covered so far in this file. You will be able to see all the above processes and methods used here.
