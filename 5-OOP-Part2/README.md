# Object Oriented Programming Part2

>>This file shows OOP class operations like Polymorphism, Composition etc.

---

[1. House-Coposition](1.House-Coposition/src)

This is an example of Composition, the Room has a 'has a' relation with the other classes. The 'Room' class accepts the 'Furniture', 'Electric' and 
'Dimensions' classes. Fro here the 'Room' class can accept and print the values in those classes.

[2.Car-Polymorphism](2.Car-Polymorphism/src)

Polymorphism basically means having many forms. With this we can overload functions and access the parent functions. 
In this file you can see the use of 'super' and '@overload', keyword and functions. Class 'Swift' and 'Maruti', both are types of cars and extend a base class.

[3. Final-Compilation](3.Final-Compilation/src)

This shows all the OOP concepts implemented. The software is for making a burger, all the veggies are assigned and the final cost is also calculated. 
Class 'HealthyBurger' shows us examples of Composition and the class 'DeluxBurger' is an example of Polymorphism.
